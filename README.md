# considerations
documentation and thoughts to create token utility<br />
integration and testing zone for the pkNFTapi suite of NFT utility that includes API storage, royalty payment and encrypted private agent prompt trading. axelar and squid provide cross chain asset exchange<br />
ROYALNFT.t.sol are the tests that the ROYALNFT.sol has passed with foundry using forge test -vvv to follow the immutable royalty payments
storage.chainsafe is the easiest onboarding to filecoin so far
LIT for encryption and experimental PKP
Filecoin for serious data integrity
